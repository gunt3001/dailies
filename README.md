# Dailies

Dailies is a [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and [Blazor Webassembly](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) based daily diary application.

You can record your daily activites, keep track of your mood, or find out what you did this same day last year! You can browse through your activities in a calendar view or a list view.

## Instructions

Deploy and run this applicaton using the .NET Core SDK, then browse using your browser.

The application primarily uses Sqlite as its backend database. Excel spreadsheet backend is also supported in a limited fashion (read-only).

## For Educational Purposes Only!

I created this project to learn more about Microsoft's Blazor Webassembly technology. The application contains **no authentication whatsoever**, meaning once deployed anyone can read/write data.
