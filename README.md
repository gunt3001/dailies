Dailies is a [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and [Blazor Webassembly](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) based daily diary application.

You can record your daily activites, keep track of your mood, or find out what you did this same day last year! You can browse through your activities in a calendar view or a list view.

## Instructions

Deploy and run this applicaton using the .NET Core SDK, then browse using your browser.

Currently, this application only support using an Excel spreadsheet file as the backend database, though other backends are definitely planned.

## Remarks

I created this project to learn more about Microsoft's Blazor Webassembly technology, which is still in its infancy, but is an exciting new way to develop web-based applications.
